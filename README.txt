Hello!

This program simulates an OS allocating resources to processes that the user or system request.

This program requires the importation of the NetworkX library, the MatPlotLib Library, and OS library
I used the PyCharm IDE to run my program so I am unsure how to run it via command line.
The program will prompt your for an integer which represents the file number in the 
scenarios directory. It will search for the files based on a count, if it does not exist
the program will let you know it was not found and close.

Otherwise the program will find the requested file and begin the simulation. There are comments within
the code on how it runs. If you having any problems or questions please let me know!

Thank you,

Alex Lominchar
